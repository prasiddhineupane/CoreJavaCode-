//Interface is one of the way to obtain abstraction.
//Abstraction class has non-abstract method also.
//Interface only contains abstract method
//Abstraction only shows the functionality and hides other internal info.
//interface methods are by default abstract, public and final
//Interface also allows to expose functionality to the end user without
//exposing its internal details
//can obtain interface by using implements keyword

//in interface we can use multiple inheritance by  adding ,
//call by creating a reference and object of the class

public interface InterfaceCarDemo {

        void speed(); //default is abstract

        void brake();


        }
